        <h2>LABORATORY DEPARTMENTS</h2>
        <p>
          Quickheal Health maintains a full-service laboratory performing
          clinical analysis on blood, tissue and other body fluids. The
          laboratory provides much of the clinical data used by physicians to
          diagnose and treat disease and to monitor patient’s health or
          wellness. The laboratory is fully accredited by the College of
          American Pathology (CAP) and meets CLIA certification requirements.
          The laboratory is directed by a board certified Clinical and Anatomic
          Pathologist. Technologists and technicians perform a variety of
          analysis on state-of-the-art instrumentation in:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Urinalysis</li>
          <li>Bacteriology</li>
          <li>Transfusion services</li>
          <li>Hematology</li>
          <li>Chemistry</li>
          <li>Immunology</li>
          <li>Coagulation</li>
          <li>Toxicology</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Pathology services include cytology and histology procedures. Test
          results of clinical lab data are securely distributed based on
          individual patient needs. The hospital will handle processing of lab
          tests and lab billing for all Quickheal Health patients, including
          Quickheal and Rushford Clinic patients. Patients may receive separate
          bills for lab work and physician services.

        <h3>SPECIMEN ACCESSIONING AND LABELING</h3>
        <p>
          Once a specimen has been collected by a phlebotomist, nurse,
          physician, or other healthcare professional, it is sent to the
          laboratory for testing. In large hospitals, specimens may be sent
          directly to the laboratory from the patient care area via a pneumatic
          tube system, whereas smaller hospitals will have specimens picked up
          and dropped off by laboratory couriers. Once at the laboratory,
          specimens are received, sorted, registered, and then marked as
          “received” in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) before being
          labeled and processed for testing. This entire check-in process is
          often referred to as specimen accessioning and processing.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the primary responsibilities of specimen accessioning is to
          catch pre-analytical errors before the specimens are processed for
          testing. This involves ensuring:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li id="list">
            <b>Proper specimen labeling:</b> At a minimum, specimens mut be
            labeled with the patient’s full name and date of birth.
          </li>
          <li id="list">
            <b>Correct specimen type:</b> Different tests require different
            types of specimens to be collected. For example, hematology testing
            usually requires whole blood specimens collected in EDTA tubes (for
            CBC testing) or sodium citrate tubes (for coagulation studies),
            whereas chemistry test usually require blood serum or heparinized
            plasma. Other specimens include urine, stool, sputum, tissue, and
            other body fluids.
          </li>
          <li id="list">
            <b>Adequate specimen volume:</b> A minimum volume requirement is
            determined for each test offered by the laboratory. If a specimen
            does not meet the minimum volume requirements, the test will be
            cancelled as “quantity not sufficient” or “QNS” and the patient will
            need to provide a new sample.
          </li>
          <li id="list">
            <b>Stable specimen condition:</b> The date of collection and the
            temperature at which the specimens are stored must be checked to
            ensure specimen integrity. For instance, many tests allow specimens
            to be processed and stored for longer periods of time if they are
            stored in a refrigerated or frozen state.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After the specimen passes the accessioning requirements, it is
          labeled, processed, and routed to the other departments of the
          laboratory.

        <h3>ANATOMICAL PATHOLOGY</h3>
        <p>
          The medical laboratory is usually divided into an anatomical pathology
          branch and a clinical pathology branch, each made up of multiple
          departments. Larger laboratories may also contain a molecular
          pathology branch and a forensic pathology branch, while smaller
          laboratories will send specimens out to bigger labs for this type of
          testing.

        />
        <p>
          Anatomical pathology involves studying the effects of disease on the
          structure of organs, tissues, and cells. Anatomical pathology is
          typically made up of a cytotechnology department and a histology/gross
          anatomical pathology department.
        </p>
        <h4>Cytotechnology</h4>
        <p>
          Cytotechnology (also known as cytology) involves the microscopic study
          of cells to detect cancer and other cellular abnormalities in fluids
          such as PAP smears, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, and blood.
          Pathologists and cytotechnologists usually work alongside each other
          to identify abnormal cells present in fluids.

          <li>Cytopathologists</li>
          <li>Pathologists’ assistants, PA(ASCP)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Histology</h4>
        <p>
          Histology involves the gross examination and microscopic analysis of
          tissue specimens. Organs and surgical tissue biopsies are first
          examined in their entirety (known as “gross” examination) by being
          weighed, measured, and dissected. The specimens are then either
          processed, affixed to slides, and stained or sliced and embedded into
          wax blocks for microscopic analysis. By studying the structure and
          function of entire tissues and organs, histologists and pathologists
          can identify cancers and other signs of pathogenesis.

        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>CLINICAL PATHOLOGY</h3>
        <p>
          Clinical pathologists oversea and collaborate with medical laboratory
          scientists and technicians to analyze various bodily fluids in four
          main clinical areas:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Clinical chemistry Transfusion services</li>
          <li>Hematology and Hemostasis</li>
          <li>Microbiology</li>
          <li>Transfusion services</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Clinical Chemistry</h4>
        <p>
          The chemistry department is usually the largest and most automated
          part of the laboratory. It is sometimes divided into many different
          subspecialty areas, including automated chemistry, STAT chemistry,
          immunology, toxicology, endocrinology, and special chemistry. Common
          tests include the comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function
          studies, lipid panel, hormone and vitamin assays, drug screens, and
          troponin – a cardiac marker that is used to indicate whether a patient
          has had a heart attack.
        </p>
        <h4>Hematology and Hemostasis</h4>
        <p>
          The hematology department is responsible for analyzing a patient’s
          blood and blood components. By analyzing the number and maturity of
          red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in a whole blood
          sample, medical scientists can detect diseases such as leukemia and
          anemia. Hematology also involves coagulation studies and platelet
          function assays (an area usually referred to as hemostasis) to help
          detect clotting problems and monitor drug therapies. Urinalysis, sperm
          counts, and malaria testing are some more examples of testing done in
          a hematology department.
        </p>
        <h4>Microbiology</h4>
        <p>
          From bacteria and viruses to fungi and parasites, microbiology is the
          study of all things tiny. The goal of any clinical microbiology lab is
          to detect and identify pathogenic microorganisms causing disease in a
          patient. Various specimens are first cultured onto media using
          different techniques. The goal of culturing is to isolate pure
          colonies of bacteria, mold, or fungi that can then be identified using
          methods such as mass spectrometry or PCR. Once identified, antibiotic
          susceptibility testing is usually performed to determine the best
          course of antibiotic therapy for the patient. Other testing in the
          microbiology lab includes gram staining, ova and parasite tests, STD
          testing, and rapid tests for strep and other common pathogens.
        </p>
        <h4>Transfusion Services</h4>
        <p>
          Immunohematology, also known as “Transfusion Services” or more
          commonly “Blood Bank”, is the area of the clinical laboratory
          responsible for providing compatible blood components to patients for
          transfusion. The blood bank keeps an inventory of red blood cells,
          plasma, platelets, and cryoprecipitate available for routine blood
          transfusions, surgeries, and traumas. When a patient needs blood, the
          blood bank is responsible for determining the patient’s blood type,
          testing for and identifying any antibodies present, and then providing
          crossmatch compatible blood components.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY</h3>
        <p>
          In larger laboratories, molecular and genetic testing might be done in
          a separate branch of pathology known as molecular pathology. Molecular
          pathologists usually work with medical scientists in two main areas,
          cytogenetics and molecular diagnostics.
        </p>

        <h4>Cytogenetics</h4>
        <p>
          Cytogenetic testing involves isolating and studying the structure of
          chromosomes. Cytogenetic technologists use different stains and
          techniques to create an image of chromosomes known as a karyotype. By
          analyzing a patient’s karyotype, cytogenetic technologists and
          molecular pathologists can identify a variety of chromosomal
          abnormalities that may lead to genetic defects such as Downs syndrome,
          Klinefelter syndrome, and Philadelphia chromosome.

          <li>Medical laboratory scientists, MLS(ASCP)</li>
          <li>Molecular pathologists</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Molecular Diagnostics</h4>
        <p>
          Molecular testing involves testing a sequence of DNA or RNA to
          identify a specific genetic marker of interest. This could involve
          testing the patient’s DNA to detect gene variants that cause inherited
          disease or make them more susceptible to cancers. It can also be used
          to identify the presence of infectious organisms and antibiotic
          resistant genes.
